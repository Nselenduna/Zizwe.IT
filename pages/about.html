        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        
        <div class="about-content">
            <img src="../images/founder-photo.jpg" alt="Lloyd - Founder of Zizwe IT" class="founder-photo">
            <div class="founder-bio">
                <h3>Meet Lloyd - Founder & Developer</h3>
                <p>I'm Lloyd, a Registered Nurse in the UK and the founder of Zizwe.IT Limited.</p>
                <p>Like most nurses, I found NMC revalidation tedious and time-consuming. Like most small business owners, I saw independent shops struggling against chains with bigger tech budgets. Like most Ndebele speakers, I wished for digital spaces that felt like home.</p>
                <p>The difference? I learned to code.</p>
                <p>Zizwe.IT exists because I got tired of waiting for someone else to solve these problems. We build technology for communities that are often overlooked—not because they're unprofitable, but because the people making decisions don't understand them.</p>
                <p><strong>We understand them because we are them.</strong></p>

    <!-- Our Philosophy -->
    <section class="alt-bg">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            
            <div class="approach-grid">
                <div class="approach-card">
                    <h3>Low Cost, High Impact</h3>
                    <p>Affordable doesn't mean basic. It means removing the bloat, the unnecessary features, the enterprise sales overhead. It means focusing ruthlessly on what actually matters to the people using our products.</p>
                    <p>We price our solutions at what makes sense for the communities we serve—not what maximizes our margins.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="approach-card">
                    <h3>Community Expertise</h3>
                    <p>There's a massive advantage to building technology for communities you belong to. You understand the real problems, not the imagined ones. You know which features matter and which are just nice-to-haves. You have immediate access to the people who need what you're building.</p>
                    <p>This isn't just good business—it's how you build things people actually want to use.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="approach-card">
                    <h3>Responsive Innovation</h3>
                    <p>We move fast, but we don't break things. Healthcare technology requires professional reliability. Small business tools need to just work. Community platforms need to feel safe.</p>
                    <p>We bring startup energy to execution without compromising on trust. Agile development, professional standards.</p>

        <h2>Why Trust Zizwe.IT</h2>
        
        <div class="approach-grid">
            <div class="approach-card">
                <h3>Healthcare-Grade Security</h3>
                <p>We build with the same privacy and security standards required in healthcare settings. GDPR compliance isn't an afterthought—it's built into our architecture from day one.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="approach-card">
                <h3>Real Products, Real Users</h3>
                <p>Revalidator is live on the Google Play Store. It's helping nurses today. We don't launch until we're ready, but when we launch, it works.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="approach-card">
                <h3>UK-Based with UK Understanding</h3>
                <p>We understand NMC requirements, UK small business challenges, and the regulatory landscape. We're not trying to adapt American solutions—we're building British ones.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="approach-card">
                <h3>Founder-Led</h3>
                <p>Every product we build has my personal attention. This isn't a corporation optimizing for quarterly earnings. This is a founder solving problems that matter.</p>
